                <span class="small-header">A PICC</span> is long, small flexible plastic tube that
                is put in your arm and threaded so that the tip rests in a big vein in the chest.
                The catheter can be used for all types of fluids and medications that need to be
                given into your vein. A nurse has been specially trained and qualified to insert
                this catheter will be putting it in. This catheter can stay in your arm for one
                year or more as long as there are no complications needing it to be removed. After
                insertion of the catheter, a chest x-ray will be taken to make sure it is in the
                correct place before it is used.

                <span class="small-header">BENEFITS:</span> Having a <span class="small-header">PICC</span>
                line would eliminate the need for peripheral blood draws or starting an IV (intravenous
                catheter). Certain medications or nutritional solutions that are given via an IV
                can irritate small veins. A <span class="small-header">PICC</span> line helps to
                decrease vein irritation should you receive antibiotics for more than a week, IV
                pain medications or IV cancer drugs. A <span class="small-header">PICC</span> line
                can be left in place when you go home. If you go home with a <span class="small-header">
                    PICC</span> line in place, home care can be set up to help you.
